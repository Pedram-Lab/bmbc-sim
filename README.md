# ECM simulations
A collection of scripts for solving problems that arise in extracellular matrix simulations using [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org/).

### Setup
This project uses [uv]() to manage the environment and dependencies.
To install, simply run the following command from the root of the project:
```bash
uv sync
```

Then, you should be able to use the environment in any IDE.
To run scripts from the terminal, simply use:
```bash
uv run python <filename>
```

### Examples
Currently, all examples are located in the `scripts/` directory. Apart from simulations, there are some files that showcase how to use some aspects of NGSolve in greater detail, since the documentation is sometimes lacking for what we need. These are located in the `tutorials/` subfolder.
